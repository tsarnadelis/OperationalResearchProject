# Operational Reserach 2024 <br> Flight Landing Scheduling and Fuel Delivery Optimization

This project involves solving two optimization problems using Google Colab and Gurobi: scheduling flight landings at an airport, and planning the delivery oil to multiple cities.

## Project Overview
This repository contains two optimization problems solved using Google Colab and Gurobi. The first problem focuses on scheduling the landings of flights at an airport with a single runway. The second problem addresses the delivery of heating oil from a refinery to various cities while minimizing the total travel distance.

## Flight Landing Scheduling

The problem involves scheduling the landings of 10 flights at an airport with a single runway. Each flight has a time window within which it can land and penalties for landing either earlier or later than its estimated arrival time. The objective is to minimize the total penalty while satisfying the minimum required separation times between landings.

## Fuel Delivery Optimization

A transport company needs to deliver oil from a refinery to customers in six different cities. The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled while meeting the demand of each city.
